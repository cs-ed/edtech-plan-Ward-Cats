# Educational Technology Plan
This educational technology plan is being prepared by Mr. Ward for the administration of Gustine High School explain the desired new Computer Science class sought to be offered to students. This is to guide the purchase and implementation of hardware and software for AP Computer Science Principles.

## Context

### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles
The AP Computer Science Principles course introduces students to the field of computer science. This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science. In this course, we will focus on five big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computer systems and networks, and the impact of computing.

This course is open to sophomores to seniors and prepares students to take the *AP Computer Science Principles* exam.

Prerequisites:
- Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
- Completed CS Discoveries with a C- or better both semesters

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
