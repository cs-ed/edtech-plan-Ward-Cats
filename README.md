# Educational Technology Plan
This educational technology plan is being prepared by Mr. Ward for the administration of Gustine High School (GHS) to explain the desired new Computer Science class sought to be offered to students. This is to guide the implementation of the AP Computer Science Principles course. Of note, at the nearby UC Merced, [computer science and engineering is the second-largest undergraduate major with more than 1,000 students enrolled per year](https://cio.ucop.edu/uc-merced-brings-nsf-computer-science-for-all-program-to-merced-schools/). This course could also serve the desire to provide students further math class offerings [provided it meet the UC A-G Policy Resource Guide](https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/guide/a-g-subject-requirements/c-mathematics/).

## Context

### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles
The AP Computer Science Principles course introduces students to the field of computer science. This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science. In this course, we will focus on five big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computer systems and networks, and the impact of computing.

This course will be submitted to [University of California High School Articulation](https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/guide/) as a third year math course for students to have further options after the completion of Integrated Math 1 and Integrated Math 2 in their freshman and sophomore years. This course is open to students in grades 11-12 and prepares students to take the *AP Computer Science Principles* exam.

Prerequisites:
- Completed Integrated Math 1 with a D- or better both semesters
- Completed Integrated Math 2 with a D- or better both semesters

### Situation
Gustine is a rural, agrarian community about 29 miles west of the county seat of Merced. The 2010 census indicated that the City of Gustine has 5,500 residents. Gustine High School, opened in 1913, serves about 600 students and is the sole comprehensive high school within Gustine Unified School District. 82.16% of the students are Hispanic, and many are the children of recent immigrants who are attending a school in the United States for the first time while learning a new language. 18.1% of the Gustine High School students are English-language learners.

Three years ago the school district went 1:1 with Chromebooks and Mr. Ward introduced a Computer Concepts & Applications / Business Applications course to provide students a greater understanding of what and how they could use their Chromebook and the Google Suite.

With the pandemic, there were investments in infrastructure (technology upgrades for staff, purchasing more software licenses) as the district went to distance learning in March, 2019, and remained that way until January, 2020, when reopening in a hybrid format. The district returned to traditional instruction for the 2021-2022 school year with students on campus.

Considerations:
- The school bell schedule is changed frequently. This year we are now on a traditional schedule of 45 minute class periods and a built-in 30 minute support period. 
- The district has contracted with a third-party company to provide technical support and deal with the IT of the district.
- Many students experience slow or limited Wi-Fi access at home; and students are more comfortable on their smart phone than Chromebook.

### Application
Gustine is a Google district, so communicating with students, course instructions, references, and information is all posted on Google Classroom.

[Code.org is one of the ready-to-use curricula endorsed by the College Board](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/classroom-resources/curricula-pedagogical-support?course=ap-computer-science-principles) which will be used for [Computer Science Fundamentals - Express](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/express-course) as the introduction to the course, along with Code.org's [Computer Science Principles](https://code.org/educate/csp) curriculum. Gustine has taken to the CRA view; Concrete, Representational, Abstract, so [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) will be enlisted in the beginning of the course as well to support students in seeing how different commands, when the program is run, yields results that the computer interprets from their inputs.

In class, students would typically be seated in groups of four and be able to interact as they are presented with a problet to investigate and work on. Using the projector onto the whiteboard wall, students will show their thinking and their approach. After students build a repertoire of skills from problets, the class can move onto labs as students then need to take the skills developed in multiple problets and combine them into solutions to labs. Likewise, after a unit's problets and labs, the unit will conclude with a project that students can use to show everything they have learned from the unit. New content will be presented by lecture, EdPuzzle, jigsaw activities, and guided classroom discussion. This is also aligned with Hattie's visible learning blueprint, another district initiative.

In terms of homework, the plan would not be to give much; in the hopes that the time we have in class is enough to complete the content, as students have inconsistent and differing Internet connections outside of school. Even then, the school Internet does occasionally go down, and therefore there will be "unplugged" computation and activities also ready and utilized. Outside of class may warrant students attending office hours after school if they do need additional time for Internet access. There may be times when students do need to work on "unplugged" activities outside of class, or do brainstorming in preparation for a future class session.

Assessments will serve two purposes: (1) assess student comprehension and learning; also (2) prepare students for the AP exam. Consequently, assessments will be mindful of the end-of-course exam experience as laid out on [collegeboard](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles?course=ap-computer-science-principles) with multiple-choice (single- and multiple-select) questions, and some questions related to reading passage about computing.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges, and/or evolving course contexts.

AP Computer Science Principles continues down that path that Gustine has been forging. Originally students were provided Chromebooks. That is a good start, but a tool is only as useful as the user's knowledge of it. With the Computer Concepts / Business Applications course, students are learning about the great resource their Chromebook is, and what the different applications in the Google Suite allow them to do. For the 2021-2022 school year, in partnership with Stanford University's YouCubed, Gustine implemented a Data Science course. Computer Science Principles, like Data Science, helps students build their creative problem solving skills and how to apply computational processes to analyze large datasets. Meanwhile, it takes the knowledge students learned in Business Applications--about working on a Chromebook--and goes further in presenting more about global impacts of computing, Internet structures, and cybersecurity issues. Together, these three courses, while different, are all moving in tandem, in the same direction, in working to help students utilize technology that can have a practical impact and learn skills relevant across multiple disciplines and industries.

Computer Science benefits society. As educators, we can help position our students for success by equipping them with the knowledge and skills they can use to achieve. Gustine High's student learner outcomes are to create students who are college and career ready. This course can empower our students and provide them with an introductory knowledge into this field which is not the only way it can support students. Education is always working from behind as we are trying to prepare students for an unknown future, with jobs that may not even exist yet. As it stands now, the field of Computer Science looks to be growing and a great pathway to help our students establish a strong foundation for success in life. Even so, Computer Science follows the scientific paradigm, of developing hypotheses and testing them through experiments. In the creation of a program, students will have to think through their plans before diving in to try and implement them.

Like Data Science with the data science process, Computer Science is also a different approach to math. Math is not just about solving for a variable or calculating the solution, though those things are part of traditional math courses. Instead, I have explained to students that math is the foundation of the universe; that math is all around us. To be able to think, reason, and problem-solve is imperative.  With the "Why do I have to earn this?" questions, I admit that while they may not have to solve a system of equations in life, but being able to think, reason, and come to a conclusion--a solution-- and then be able to communicate their process in a way that others can follow and understand, *that* is the benefit and purpose for math. I would say Computer Science is a different approach for the same end goal. Students who take the course may not all be targeting Computer Science majors. That is okay; it can still be a worthwhile and beneficial endeavor. This Computer Science Principles course is another approach to students developing their reasoning, thinking, and communication skills. These are invaluable skills that they need to master for Gustine High to claim we have done our duty in positioning our students for both college and career readiness.
